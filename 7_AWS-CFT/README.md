## ðŸ”§ What is CloudFormation?

**AWS CloudFormation** is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that lets you define AWS resources in **YAML or JSON** templates. You can create, update, and delete entire environments using a single template.

CFT act as a middleware between user and cloud and it supports Json, yaml template and is for AWS cloud only. It converts declerative and versioned template to Api call that AWS compatible.

CFT also provides Drift Detection, like unintentional changes happended, then you can go to CFT and there is option of detect drift.

How to transfer yaml files to AWS CFT? Well there is stack, "stack" refers to a collection of AWS resources that are managed as a single unit. These resources are defined in a CloudFormation template, which is a JSON or YAML file describing the desired state of the infrastructure.CloudFormation helps detect "drift," which occurs when changes are made to stack resources outside of the CloudFormation template. This helps maintain the integrity of your infrastructure.
For managing stacks across multiple AWS accounts and regions, CloudFormation provides "Stack Sets," allowing you to deploy and manage stacks in a centralized manner.
