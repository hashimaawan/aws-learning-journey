# 🌩️ AWS Learning Journey by Hashim Awan

Welcome to my **AWS Learning Journey**! 🚀  
I'm currently learning and practicing Amazon Web Services (AWS) by working hands-on with core services, writing notes, and documenting real-world usage of the AWS Console and CLI.

This repository serves as a **public learning log and knowledge base** where I’m sharing what I learn every day — from basic cloud concepts to advanced networking and deployments.
